## How Patients Login

### Step 1: Registration
1. Visit the website homepage
2. Click "Register" or "Get Started"
3. Fill in the registration form with:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email
   - Phone Number
   - National Identification Number (NIN)

6. **IMPORTANT**: Save this HealthMR ID - you need it to login!

### Step 2: Account Activation
After registration, your account needs to be activated by hospital staff. This creates your login credentials automatically using:
- **Email**: The email you provided
- **Password**: Your NIN + "@HealthMR" (e.g., if NIN is 12345678901, password is 12345678901@HealthMR)

### Step 3: Login
1. Go to the Patient Login page
2. Enter your **HealthMR ID** (from registration)
3. Enter your **NIN** (11-digit number)
4. Click "Login"
5. You'll be redirected to your dashboard
